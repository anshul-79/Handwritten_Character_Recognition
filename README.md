# EMNIST Classification Project

This project involves classifying handwritten characters using the EMNIST dataset with the help of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The dataset is processed and augmented to improve model performance, and the trained model is evaluated and saved for future use.

## Dataset

The project uses the EMNIST Balanced dataset, which contains images of handwritten characters and their labels. The dataset is divided into training and testing sets.

- **Dataset URL:** [EMNIST Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/crawford/emnist?select=emnist-balanced-mapping.txt)

## Key Steps

1. **Data Preparation:**
   - The dataset is downloaded from the URL above and extracted from ZIP or TAR files.
   - Images and labels are loaded into Pandas DataFrames.
   - Images are reshaped into a format suitable for training and testing.

2. **Data Augmentation:**
   - Various image augmentation techniques, such as rotations, shifts, and zooms, are applied to the training dataset to enhance model robustness.

3. **Model Building and Training:**
   - A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is built using TensorFlow and Keras, including layers such as Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, and Dense.
   - The model is trained with early stopping to prevent overfitting.

   ### Model Structure

   The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) used in this project consists of the following layers:

   - **Input Layer:** Accepts 28x28 grayscale images.
   - **Convolutional Layers:**
     - **Conv2D (32 filters, 5x5 kernel):** Extracts basic features.
     - **BatchNormalization:** Normalizes activations.
     - **Conv2D (32 filters, 5x5 kernel):** Extracts more complex features.
     - **BatchNormalization:** Normalizes activations.
     - **Conv2D (64 filters, 3x3 kernel):** Detects finer details.
     - **BatchNormalization:** Normalizes activations.
   - **MaxPooling2D:** Reduces spatial dimensions (2x2 pool size).
   - **Dropout (25%):** Helps prevent overfitting.
   - **Flatten:** Converts 2D feature maps to 1D vector.
   - **Dense (256 units, ReLU):** High-level feature representation.
   - **Dense (47 units, Softmax):** Classifies into 47 categories.

   The model is designed to effectively learn and classify handwritten characters through a combination of feature extraction and classification layers.

4. **Evaluation:**
   - The trained model is evaluated on the test dataset, achieving an accuracy of approximately 89%.
   - Training and validation accuracy and loss are plotted to visualize model performance over epochs.

5. **Model Saving and Loading:**
   - The trained model is saved to a file and can be loaded for future predictions.

## Results

- **Test Accuracy:** The model achieves an accuracy of approximately 89% on the test dataset.
- **Visualizations:** Accuracy and loss plots for training and validation data are provided.
