EMNIST Classification Project
This project involves classifying handwritten characters using the EMNIST dataset with the help of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The dataset is processed and augmented to improve model performance, and the trained model is evaluated and saved for future use.

Dataset
The project uses the EMNIST Balanced dataset, which contains images of handwritten characters and their labels. The dataset is divided into training and testing sets.

Key Steps
Data Preparation:

The dataset is downloaded from the URL above and extracted from ZIP or TAR files.
Images and labels are loaded into Pandas DataFrames.
Images are reshaped into a format suitable for training and testing.
Data Augmentation:

Various image augmentation techniques, such as rotations, shifts, and zooms, are applied to the training dataset to enhance model robustness.
Model Building and Training:

A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is built using TensorFlow and Keras, including layers such as Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, and Dense.
The model is trained with early stopping to prevent overfitting.
Evaluation:

The trained model is evaluated on the test dataset, achieving an accuracy of approximately 89%.
Training and validation accuracy and loss are plotted to visualize model performance over epochs.
Model Saving and Loading:

The trained model is saved to a file and can be loaded for future predictions.
Results
Test Accuracy: The model achieves an accuracy of approximately 89% on the test dataset.
Visualizations: Accuracy and loss plots for training and validation data are provided.
